## The influence of waves and bubbles on oxygen in the ocean interior
Authors: Paridhi Rustogi, Laure Resplandy, Seth Bushinksy and Luc Deike

Creation Date: December 11, 2025

This repository contains the scripts needed to reproduce the figures for Rustogi et al. (Submitted), which investigates how wave-bubble processes modify air-sea oxygen exchange, mixed layer oxygen saturation, and interior ventilation across water masses.

The code compares two gas exchange formulations:

1. Wind–wave–bubble formulation (Deike et al. 2025)
2. Wind-dependent formulation (Wanninkhof 2014)

Model output is evaluated against quality-controlled biogeochemical Argo observations in key mode and deep water mass formation regions.
